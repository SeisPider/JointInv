### Isolation 
1. Measured group and phase velocity dispersion curve in <id>.disp.out is not 
reliable. This group velocity generated by phase-matched filter.

2. Re-measured group dispersion curve with sacmft96 is different from that in 
disp.out obtained by interpolation.

### Common line judgment
1. Now, I can't scan isolated stations in database
