### Isolation 
1. Measured group and phase velocity dispersion curve in <id>.disp.out is not 
reliable. This group velocity generated by phase-matched filter.

2. Re-measured group dispersion curve with sacmft96 is different from that in 
disp.out obtained by interpolation.

### Common line judgment
1. Now, I can't scan isolated stations in database [fixed 20171029]

### Training data construction
1. I have finished construting training data of phase velocity extraction stored
in ../data/isotraces/\*/rayl.dsp while outliers in outlier.dsp.
