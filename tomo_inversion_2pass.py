[Advice: run this script using python with unbuffered output:
`python -u tomo_inversion_2pass.py`]

This script performs a two-pass tomographic inversion of a set of
observed travel-times (equivalent to observed velocities) between
pairs of stations, at various periods.

The script takes as input one or several binary files containing a
list of dispersion curves (previously calculated with, e.g., script
dispersion_curves.py), located in folder *FTAN_DIR*. A dispersion
curve is an instance of pstomo.DispersionCurve exported in binary
format with module pickle.

In the first pass, an overdamped tomographic inversion is
performed, and the residuals between observed/predicted
travel-time are estimated for all pairs of stations).

A second tomographic inversion is then performed, after
rejecting the pairs whose absolute residual is larger than 3 times
the standard deviation of the residuals.

The inversion is an implementation of the algorithm described
by Barmin et al., "A fast and reliable method for surface wave
tomography", Pure Appl. Geophys. (2001). The travel paths are
assumed to follow great circles between pairs of stations, so
that the relationship between the data (travel-time anomalies
between pairs of stations) and the parameters (slowness anomalies
at grid nodes) is linear. The penalty function is then composed
of three terms: the first represents the misfit between observed
and predicted data; the second is a spatial smoothing condition;
the third penalizes the weighted norm of the parameters:

- the spatial smoothing is controlled by a strength parameter,
  *alpha*, and a correlation length, *corr_length*;

- the norm penalization is controlled by a strength parameter,
  *beta*, and decreases as the path density increases, as
  exp[- *lambda* * path density]

Before the inversion is performed, several selection criteria
are applied to filter out low quality observed velocities.
The criteria are as follows:

1) period <= distance * *maxperiodfactor* (normally, distance / 12)
2) for velocities having a standard deviation associated:
   - standard deviation <= *maxsdev*
   - SNR >= *minspectSNR*
3) for velocities NOT having a standard deviation associated:
   - SNR >= *minspectSNR_nosdev*

The standard deviation of a velocity is estimated from the set
of trimester velocities (i.e., velocities estimated by performing
FTANs on cross-correlations calculated with 3 months of data,
Jan-Feb-Mar, Feb-Mar-Apr ... Dec-Jan-Feb) for which the SNR
is >= *minspectSNR*, and if at least *minnbtrimester* trimester
velocities are available.

The default value of all the parameters mentioned above is
defined in the configuration file, and can be overridden
when the inversion is performed, in pstomo.VelocityMap().

The maps (1st pass, 2nd pass of the two-pass inversion + map
of a one-pass inversion for comparison, at each period) are
exported as figures  in a pdf file in dir *TOMO_DIR*.
The final maps (2nd pass of the two-pass inversion at each
period) are exported in binary format using module pickle
as a dict: {period: instance of pstomo.VelocityMap}.
