[Advice: run this script using python with unbuffered output:
`python -u tomo_inversion_testparams.py`]

This script performs tomographic inversions of a set of
observed travel-times (equivalent to observed velocities)
between pairs of stations, systematically varying
the selection and inversion parameters: period, grid size,
min SNR etc.

The script takes as input one or several binary files containing a
list of dispersion curves (previously calculated with, e.g., script
dispersion_curves.py), located in folder *FTAN_DIR*. A dispersion
curve is an instance of pstomo.DispersionCurve exported in binary
format with module pickle.

The inversion is an implementation of the algorithm described
by Barmin et al., "A fast and reliable method for surface wave
tomography", Pure Appl. Geophys. (2001). The travel paths are
assumed to follow great circles between pairs of stations, so
that the relationship between the data (travel-time anomalies
between pairs of stations) and the parameters (slowness anomalies
at grid nodes) is linear. The penalty function is then composed
of three terms: the first represents the misfit between observed
and predicted data; the second is a spatial smoothing condition;
the third penalizes the weighted norm of the parameters:

- the spatial smoothing is controlled by a strength parameter,
  *alpha*, and a correlation length, *corr_length*;

- the norm penalization is controlled by a strength parameter,
  *beta*, and decreases as the path density increases, as
  exp[- *lambda* * path density]

Before the inversion is performed, several selection criteria
are applied to filter out low quality observed velocities.
The criteria are as follows:

1) period <= distance * *maxperiodfactor* (normally, distance / 12)
2) for velocities having a standard deviation associated:
   - standard deviation <= *maxsdev*
   - SNR >= *minspectSNR*
3) for velocities NOT having a standard deviation associated:
   - SNR >= *minspectSNR_nosdev*

The standard deviation of a velocity is estimated from the set
of trimester velocities (i.e., velocities estimated by performing
FTANs on cross-correlations calculated with 3 months of data,
Jan-Feb-Mar, Feb-Mar-Apr ... Dec-Jan-Feb) for which the SNR
is >= *minspectSNR*, and if at least *minnbtrimester* trimester
velocities are available.

The default value of all the parameters mentioned above is
defined in the configuration file, and can be overridden
when the inversion is performed, in pstomo.VelocityMap().

The results are exported in a pdf file in dir *TOMO_DIR*
