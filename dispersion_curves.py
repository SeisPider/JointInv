[Advice: run this script using python with unbuffered output:
`python -u dispersion_curves.py`]

This script implements the two-step frequency-time analysis
(FTAN) on a set of cross-correlations, as described by Levshin &
Ritzwoller, "Automated detection, extraction, and measurement
of regional surface waves", Pure Appl. Geoph. (2001) and Bensen
et al., "Processing seismic ambient noise data to obtain
reliable broad-band surface wave dispersion measurements",
Geophys. J. Int. (2007).

In short, the envelope's amplitude of the (analytic representation
of the) cross-correlation is calculated and displayed after applying
narrow bandpass filters: this gives a 2D image, in which the x-axis
is the nominal period (filter's center period) or the instanteneous
period and the  y-axis is time (equivalent to velocity). Tracking
the time (equivalent to velocity) at which  the amplitude reaches
its maximum for each  period gives the dispersion curve, i.e., the
group velocity function  of period. This 'raw' dispersion curve is
used to set up a phase-matched filter, re-apply a 'clean' FTAN and
extract a 'clean' dispersion curve.

The nominal frequency (or period) -- i.e., the filter's center
frequency -- is replaced with the instantaneous frequency
if parameter *USE_INSTANTANEOUS_FREQ* is set to True, or if
use_inst_freq=True is explicitely passed to function xc.FTANs().

This script takes as input one or several binary files containing a
set of cross-correlations (previously calculated with, e.g., script
crosscorrelation.py), located in folder *CROSSCORR_DIR*. A set of
cross-correlations is an instance of pscrosscorr.CrossCorrelationCollection
exported in binary format with module pickle. Two file per set of
cross-correlations are produced:

- a pdf file illustrating the FTAN procedure on all cross-correlations:
  one page per cross-correlation, containing the original and
  band-passed cross-correlation, the amplitude and dispersion curve
  of the raw FTAN, of the clean FTAN, and a map locating the pair
  of stations.

- a binary file containing the clean dispersion curves exported
  with module pickle
